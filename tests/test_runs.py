    Example 10.2

    A quality control study is conducted on a machine that pours milk into containers.
    The amount of milk (in liters) dispensed by the machine into 21 consecutive containers follows:
    1.90, 1.99, 2.00, 1.78, 1.77, 1.76, 1.98, 1.90, 1.65, 1.76, 2.01, 1.78, 1.99, 1.76, 1.94, 1.78,
    1.67, 1.87, 1.91, 1.91, 1.89. Are the successive increments and decrements in the amount of milk
    dispensed random?
